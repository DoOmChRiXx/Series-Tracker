# 📺 Series Tracker

Track your TV series across platforms in a simple, clean and centralized way.

A small personal tool I built to keep all my shows organized:  
list them, edit them, and track progress — all in one place.

## ⚙️ How it works

The app is intentionally straightforward:

- Platform selector on the right  
- A writing area to list and edit your shows  
- Basic formatting tools  
- Everything saved in **RTF format**

No database, no cloud, no complexity — just your list, your way.

## 💾 Installation (or not)

*This version only works on Windows 10/11.*

I provide two options:

### **1. Installer**
Includes all dependencies and ensures a smooth setup.

⚠️ **Windows 11 users:**  
Smart App Control (SAC) may block the installer with [this warning](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/smart-app-control-has-blocked-part-of-this-app-0729fff1-48bf-4b25-aa97-632fe55ccca2)  
because the app is not signed with a commercial certificate.

You can either:
1. Disable SAC, which will allow you to install it with a warning, **or**
2. Use the portable version instead

### **2. Portable version**
Just download, unzip, and run.

👉 **Both versions are available here:**

Hope it helps you keep your series organized as much as it helps me.
