# Series Tracker #

A simple app intended for my personal use, just to track all the TV Series I watch over the different platforms.
With it, I can list them, edit that list and have all in one place.

Its use is pretty straightforward: 
You have the platform options to the right, the space to write down, and the tools to edit/customize that text. 
All is saved in RTF format.

### Installation (or not) ###

*Note that this version only works on Windows 10/11.*

I created an installation package (which assures no issues regarding dependencies).

If you're on Windows 11, the Smart App Control (SAC) will probably block the installation with [this message](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/smart-app-control-has-blocked-part-of-this-app-0729fff1-48bf-4b25-aa97-632fe55ccca2), just because the app is not signed with a commercial certificate.
Here you have two options:

1. Either you set the SAC off, or
2. Download the portable version of the app

Both of them can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DoOmChRiXx/Series-Tracker/releases)
